###### Firebase Authentication:

1. signUp(create users) done using `createUserWithEmailAndPassword`
2. used `Auth` in central place(firebase.jsx) to use it over all the components
3. signIn done using `signInWithEmailAndPassword`

###### Done

### development Stages
1. header
2. home page
3. routing
4. Create signIn or SignUp form
5. form validation
6. useRef - used to get reference to a variable / form data
    - it will give the reference to the inputbox
    - email.current.value gives the value of the email input box
7. signup form has fullname field
8. google firebase authentication
    - create a project
    - add firebase to web app
    - add a project
    - copy firebase config to firebase.jsx
    - enable authentication
        - email/password sigin method
        - to get rid of error, disable CORS Chrome extensions and retry
9. firebase setup
10. deploy app for production
11. Authentication : Implement Signup user API
12. Implement SignIn user API
13. Create a Redux Store (appStore.jsx)
14. Provide the Redux Store to React (App.jsx)
15. Create a Redux State Slice (userSlice.jsx)
16. Add Slice Reducers to the Store (appStore.jsx)
17. dispatch actions to the store:
    - whenever the user signIn/ SignUp/ SignOut we need to dipatch the action each time. 
    - so to avoid this there is an utility provided by firebase called `onAuthStateChanged`. use this to dipatch an action.
    - `onAuthStateChanged` is like an event listener calls only one time. So `useEffect` hook is used.
    - `onAuthStateChanged` is used in header.jsx(if it is called in app.jsx routing error may happen)
18. implemented Signout
19. updata User profile after creating a user and redirect to `/browse`
20.  Bug Fix: 
        - update displayname in `header.jsx`
        - If user is not loggedIn redirect from `/browse` to `login` page.
21. Browse Page Header UI
    - logo
    - home
    - Movies
    - My List
    - Search
    - username
    - avatar
22. unsubcribe to the `onAuthStateChanged` callback when component unmounts.
23. put image contants in one file
24. Register for TMDB API and create an application and get access token
    - generate authentication key
    - read documentaion
25. created `constants_api.jsx` and copy the api options 
25. make api call from `browse.jsx` and list down `now playing movies`
26. fetch data from TMDB API and store in redux store
27. create a custom hook and put all those api logic in that. so our code(`browse.jsx`) will be clean.
28. building browse page UI
-  Created movieSlice
- update store with now playing movies data
- planning for video container
- read first movie data from store using `nowPlayingMovies` 
- created custom hook for fetch trailer video of first movie
- update store with trailer video data
- read trailer key from store and update `VideoBg.jsx` with video
- embed youtube video using iframe and make it autoplay
- 


### begining of structure of UI  ####
1. home page
    - Header
    - login/signup form
    - redirect to browse page
2. Browse (after authentication)
    - Header
    - Main container
        - recent movie tailer in background
            - title & description
        - movie suggestions
            - movielists
                - cards
        
### ending of structure of UI  ####



### git commands:

1. git init
2. git remote add origin <URL>
3. git branch -M main
4. git push -u origin main
5. if any changes did in code do commit before `push cmd`


### form library
`Formik`

### CSS preprocessors:
 - Sass, Less, and Stylus.
### Tailwind CSS:
 - is a `PostCSS plugin`
 - Using PostCSS as your preprocessor our `builds will be faster`.
 - Tailwind often uses @tailwind, @apply, theme() keywords. To use these tailwind uses postcss.

### Post CSS:
 - is a `framework` 
 - PostCSS is a JavaScript tool that transforms your CSS code into an abstract syntax tree (AST) 
 - it provides `linting, minifying, inserting vendor prefixes `etc
 - it is neither a post-processor nor a pre-processor
 - is a `transpiler` like `Babel `
 - `optimizing CSS`
 - PostCSS is a tool for transforming styles with JavaScript plugins, and it is commonly used in conjunction with build tools like webpack or parcel for processing and optimizing CSS


### Autoprefixer:
- Autoprefixer will use the data based on current browser popularity and property support to apply prefixes for you.
 - adds vendor prefix
        ::-moz-placeholder {
        color: gray;
        }

### formatting code in Visual Studio Code
Mac (macOS): Shift + Option + F 


Bug Fix:
1. change CSS in iframe video
2.
